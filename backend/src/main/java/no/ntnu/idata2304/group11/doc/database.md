# database directory

This directory contains the program which represents the database-client.


#### DataBaseClient.java

    Responsible for both connecting to the database-server, querying relevant data, manipulate and insert new data. The class is made static, making it possible to run its methods without actually creating an instance of the class.

    The testing of this class has not been performed with JUnit-tests, but by checking the values through the web-application and myPhpAdmin. The reasons are the same as for the Coordinator-class.
